            <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>

            <p>
                My name is Anastasia Paskaleva, I’m 21 years old and from Plovdiv.
                I graduated from the National High School of Trade and Commerce
                with a major in Banking, and I am currently a second-year student
                at the Technical University of Sofia, specializing in Business
                Informatics (Wirtschaftsinformatik).
                <br>
            </p>

            <p>
                I've been drawn to social media since I was a child, which led me
                to create my own YouTube channel where I share moments from my
                daily life and aim to be helpful to others. That’s where my
                passion for video editing was born.
            </p>

            <p>
                Wanting to grow my presence on social media, I started looking
                for courses on the topic. I’ve completed many, including
                "Instaboom", "Instasell", "MyStories", “InstaUGS”, inStories,
                the “Blogger as a Profession” marathon, “Storymaker”, and others.

                <h2>Graphic Design</h2>
                <p>I've been working in graphic design for two years, creating presentations for courses, marathons, and
                    webinars, designing logos for brands and businesses, and crafting creative templates for guides,
                    handbooks, e-books, and more.</p>

                <h2>Video Editing</h2>
                <p>My passion for video editing began over five years ago, but I started pursuing it more professionally
                    just over a year ago. I edit videos for all social media platforms, most frequently for YouTube and
                    Instagram (reels). I create content for brands and individuals who want to grow their presence on
                    social
                    media.</p>

                <h2>Social Media Management</h2>
                <p>For about a year now, I’ve been managing social media profiles—a role I truly enjoy. I mentor a few
                    girls, helping them maintain and grow their profiles, and I also work with brands whose accounts I
                    manage entirely.</p>

                <h2>Content Creation for Social Media</h2>
                <p>I’ve been creating content for social media for over two years. It all started with helping friends
                    who
                    owned small businesses by shooting product photos for their websites. Over time, what began as a
                    favor
                    turned into a hobby and eventually grew into a source of income.</p>
